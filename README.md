# Pegs

> Peg Solitaire (also known as: Solo Noble, Brainvita, Samotnik) is a board game from Madagascar for one player involving movement of pegs on a board with holes. The standard game fills the entire board with pegs except for the central hole. The objective is, making valid moves, to empty the entire board except for a solitary peg in the central hole.
